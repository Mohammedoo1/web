    <h2> <u> About Us </u> </h2>

    <p class="p"> As a student passionate about technology and astronomy, I developed this project as a reliable, open-source resource for space education. I noticed that many scientific topics are buried under difficult jargon, so I focused on “simplicity without sacrificing accuracy.” My goal is to transform this website into a comprehensive learning hub that inspires the next generation of explorers. It is a practical example of how digital tools can make knowledge accessible to everyone and support self-directed learning.
